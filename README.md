# Enigma
The Enigma Machine for CS61B

This project was assigned to introduce and exercise the use of recently learned data structures with an object-oriented approach to a programming problem. I like to consider
this program as the "software" for the Enigma machine that was utilized by Germany during WWII to encrypt military communications.
